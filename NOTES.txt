Hello Everyone! Welcome back to another stream.

In honor of the Black Lives Matter movement, and as an honoring to George Floyd, an innocent man killed from
police brutality.

Let's see the existing system.

It looks like the Node.js site.

But with the Node.js staff and branding removed.

Let's edit.

It's a lot of code to edit, and we can do that later.

Now, let's do the last part. Testing ALL of the changes.

It does this page on every part. My personal site also has this.

Make sure to donate to all of the sites listed.

Thanks for watching!
