Hi Everyone!

Welcome back to another stream! I have finished up the beta and made it public. Let's test it.

It redirects you to the new page. It has a cool login, similar to the beta.

Boom! It is very similar to the beta. So, let's change it.

Alright.

The center of the loader now looks very cool. Let's try to change more...

And now it adds a shrug. We can randomize messages, too, to make it look more like a traditional load.

Anyway, thanks for watching! Have a nice day!
