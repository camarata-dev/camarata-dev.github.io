Hey Everyone!

Welcome back to part 2 of Coding our first site. I have created a closed beta for the site. Let's see it.

People can fill it out and get an email back with the login link. Here, we added Material CSS to our site compared to
the old one, with multiple CSS systems.

Material (in my opinion) is the best CSS system and looks the best.

I have also created a StatusPage for page incident reporting.

Looks great! Now, we will start editing.

Please give me one second. I will be right back!

I'm back!
